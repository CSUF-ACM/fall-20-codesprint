#  Code Sprint Resources -  Fall 2020

## Welcome to Code Sprint!

All of us have great ideas about apps or products that we think could revolutionize the world and make a positive impact on our community. Too often, however, these ideas are never realized because we lack the knowledge or experience to build them. Code Sprint was created specifically to address this issue - to give you the skills, tools, and environment that will help you to build that app you've always wanted to.

Over the next ten weeks, we'll hold five learning sessions and five hack sessions.

The five learning sessions will take place from Week 1 - Week 5 and will cover Javascript ES6, the basics of React Native, Expo, and API implementation. Each session will build upon the last and mentors will be available to help you whenever needed.

The five hacking sessions will take place from Week 6 - Week 10. During this time you will get together in teams and build whatever React Native you want to. Each team will be assigned one or more mentors to guide you along your development process. At the end of the semester, you'll be able to demo your first complete cross native mobile app!

In this repository, you'll find a guidemap to all the topics we introduce this semster, and links to helpful resources.

We hope you have fun this semester, and encourage you to reach out to any of us if you have any questions or comments or send a message in the #codesprint channel on the ACM Discord Server.
